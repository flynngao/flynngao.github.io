# The production_url is only used when full-domain names are needed
# such as sitemap.txt 
# Most places will/should use BASE_PATH to make the urls
#
# If you have set a CNAME (pages.github.com) set your custom domain here.
# Else if you are pushing to username.github.com, replace with your username.
# Finally if you are pushing to a GitHub project page, include the project name at the end.

# All Jekyll-Bootstrap specific configurations are namespaced into this hash

# All links will be namespaced by BASE_PATH if defined.
# Links in your website should always be prefixed with {{BASE_PATH}}
# however this value will be dynamically changed depending on your deployment situation.

# CNAME (http://yourcustomdomain.com)
#   DO NOT SET BASE_PATH 
#   (urls will be prefixed with "/" and work relatively)

# GitHub Pages (http://username.github.com)

# GitHub Project Pages (http://username.github.com/project-name)

#   A GitHub Project site exists in the `gh-pages` branch of one of your repositories.
#  REQUIRED! Set BASE_PATH to: http://username.github.com/project-name
#
# CAUTION:
#   - When in Localhost, your site will run from root "/" regardless of BASE_PATH
#   - Only the following values are falsy: ["", null, false]
#   - When setting BASE_PATH it must be a valid url.
#     This means always setting the protocol (http|https) or prefixing with "/"
